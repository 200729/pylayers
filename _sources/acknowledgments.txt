Third party packages 
====================

Pylayers is written in Python and is standing on the shoulders of the
following giant Python packages:

* numpy ( for algebra in multi dimensions )  
* scipy ( for scientific libraries )
* SimPy ( for discrete events simulation ) 
* matplotlib ( for the graphical outputs ) 
* networkx ( for graph description and algorithms ) 
* shapely ( for planar geometry )   
* ipython ( to rule them all ... ) 


Pylayers relies also on the interactive 3D viewing program `geomview <http://www.geomview.org>`_ tool for fast and simple interaction with 3D entities. 



Developpers
===========

Pylayers is driven by professor `Bernard Uguen <http://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=WtLgPjYAAAAJ>`_ at `University of Rennes 1
<http://www.univ-rennes1.fr/english>`_, `IETR laboratory <http://www.ietr.fr/>`_ and `ESIR school of engineering <http://esir.univ-rennes1.fr/>`_

Pylayers is currently developed at IETR  by `Bernard Uguen <http://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=WtLgPjYAAAAJ>`_ , Nicolas Amiot, Mohamed
Laaraiedh and Meriem Mhedbhi, with the technical support of all the members from the
Research Team of the Propagation and Localization team of the `IETR (UMR CNRS 6164) <http://www.ietr.fr>`_ lab.    

Among early pylayers contributors : Friedman Tchoffo Talom, Louis Marie Aubert, Roxana Burghelea, Yu Lei, Taguhi
Chaluyman, Stéphane Avrillon and Eric Plouhinec (Saint-Cyr CREC research center).
