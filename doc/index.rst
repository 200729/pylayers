PyLayers : Python radio propagation and  localization simulator 
===============================================================

Pylayers is a simulator designed to model mobile pedestrian radio propagation.
The purpose is to provide a tool helping the design of localization and tracking
algorithms for advanced communications systems.


Example 
=======

.. ipython::
    
    In [1]: import pylayers.simul.simulnet as snet

    In [1]: import pylayers.simul.simulem as sem

    In [1]: Sn = snet.Simul()

    In [1]: Se = sem.Simul()


Features
========

* Indoor layout description and edition
* Extensive graph description of indoor layout  
* Multi layers transmission coefficients 
* Account fot the full vector antenna pattern  
* Motley Keenan model 
* Ray Signature determination and analysis 
* Embedded C coded modular ray tracing engine
* Handling of Impulse Radio Ultra Wideband Waveforms 
* Mobile user mobility 
* Set Membership positoning algorithm toolbox
* Heterogeneous positioning toolbox 
* Various techniques exploiting heterogeneous Radio observables



Context
=======

PyLayers has been developped to help with research into impulse radio
propagation studies and  algorithms for
localization, but it may be also useful to help with the development of
characterization, Wireless Sensor Network, MANET, radio cooperation techniques, physical layer
security ...


Third party packages 
====================

The simulator is written mostly in Python and depends on the following packages

* numpy
* scipy
* simpy
* matplotlib
* networkx   
* shapely   
* scikit-Learn
* cvxopt
  
`PYLAYERS` is designed to be easy to extend with new functionalities, 
allowing it to evolve over the time as a common
tool for research and development in a wide range of communications and
localization applications.

We warmly encourage all users to contribute 
new algorithms, models and other improvements back to the project.

Just fork the github repository on github.

Pylayers was written by Bernard Uguen, Nicolas Amiot, Mohamed Laaraiedh, Yu Lei, Roxana Burghelea
, Friedman Tchoffo Talom at the IETR, University of Rennes 1.

This work has been supported by the Bretagne Region council (Project LOCUS), by the french ANR
project AUBADE and CORMORAN and by the European projects FP7 UCELLS, FP7 WHERE1, FP7 WHERE2.
