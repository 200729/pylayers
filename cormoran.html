<h2> Project Summary </h2>

    <p>
    The CORMORAN project, a multi-partner research initiative funded in part
    by the French National Research Agency (ANR11-INFR010), has been focusing
    on new forms of cooperation in and between wireless body area networks.
    Targeted applications include coordinated navigation of groups in
    buildings or large-scale motion capture for gaming, sports and healthcare.
    </p>

     
    <p>
    Wireless body area networks (WBANs), consisting of wearable sensors or
    devices, are already being commercialized in emerging markets as diverse
    as security, rescue, health, gaming or intelligent clothing. If deployed
    in very large segments of the population, they might eventually become a
    key component of the Internet of Things (IoT) and form the skeleton of
    future distributed cooperative communication networks for mobile-device
    users.
    </p>

     

    <p>
    Protocols for communication and localization, adapted to individual and/or
    collective behavior of humans in movement (i.e. including biomechanical
    and social mobility aspects) can therefore utilize new forms of
    cooperation within and between these body sensor networks. The CORMORAN
    project, funded by the French National Research Agency, has been
    specifically investigating new mechanisms that allow WBANs to work more
    efficiently at the body scale, while also interacting and cooperating with
    other similar networks in the close vicinity. The coexistence of groups of
    equipped users can cause radio interference, but it is also a beneficial
    source of information redundancy and/or diversity through cooperation. The
    latter enables optimal data relaying or routing, and mitigation of
    packets’ losses or body obstructions, and supplies sufficiently large
    series of independent radiolocation measurements.
    </p>

     

    <p>
    Determining the proper level and modalities of such cooperation thus helps
    to optimize the quality of communications in and between WBANs, as well as
    to opportunistically locate radio devices relative to the body or even
    users carrying them in a building, for example. In addition to overcoming
    severe requirements on power consumption, the partners have also
    integrated in their investigations WBAN-specific constraints such as short
    transmission ranges, finite network topologies or periodic radio
    obstructions due to body shadowing or human movement patterns.
    </p>

     

    <p>
    To permit multi-standard WBAN deployment (i.e. involving simultaneous
    on-body, off-body and body-to-body links), project partners have been
    investigating both low-data rate and low-power wireless technologies,
    including impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) or narrow-band radio
    systems centered on 2.4GHz (e.g. ZigBee, Bluetooth - low energy etc.).
    Based on a detailed modeling of these heterogeneous wireless resources,
    the CORMORAN project aims at identifying the different layers of a
    communication protocol suitable for the new cooperative functionalities,
    including synchronization issues, radio channel access and networking, and
    management of coexistence, or radiolocation, algorithms. With its
    multidisciplinary approach, CORMORAN addresses theoretical aspects, such
    as the modeling of radio metrics and physical mobility, the design of
    algorithms and protocols. More practical aspects also include the
    characterization of the propagation channel and on-body antennas, the
    development of adapted cross-layer simulation tools and field experiments
    based on real radio platforms.
    </p>

     
    <p>
    The CORMORAN consortium includes four research laboratories with
    complementary strengths in the areas of wireless sensor networks and
    radiolocation: CEA-Leti (coordinator), INSA de Lyon-CITI, ISIC Telecom
    ParisTech–LINCS, and University of Rennes 1-IETR.
